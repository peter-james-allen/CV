## Experience

**Ferchau Engineering UK** (July 2017 to May 2020)  
Stress / FEA Engineer

- Created a program in python with a GUI using pyQT that took results from a structural simulation of the aircraft wing and stored the text based results into relational SQL databases. The program then combined results from multiple SQL files, applied different safety factors and then filtered the results on several criteria into a final output. This was achieved using numpy and pandas libraries with the combinations often created 100s of GB of data. The final results were visualised using matplotlib for checking then formatted back into text files that fed directly into the next analysis stage. The program was a success and very efficient, reducing the time of analysis from months to weeks.

## Hobbies

**Sport:** I’m an active person and like to keep fit. I particularly enjoy travelling to the alps for cycling or skiing. I'm training to do a triathalon for the first time this year.

**Music:** I am an active member of two bands, playing guitar, bass and drums at live gigs and recording in the studio. I also enjoy listening to music, going to gigs and festivals.
