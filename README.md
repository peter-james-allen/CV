# Peter Allen

An experienced and driven professional looking to move into software development having successfully completed a 16 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy. Uses Object Oriented Programming to create production ready code using a Test Driven Development approach in a team following agile methodology. Trained on both front and back-end projects using Ruby, JavaScript, Python and React.

Highly skilled in data analysis, mathematical modelling and stimulations; having worked in permanent and contracting roles as an aerospace engineer for 10 years. A strong team player, able to adapt to needs of the team or client and motivated to develop skills to fit business requirements.

Technology has always been an interest due to its constantly changing nature which gives opportunities for continuous learning and development and the chance to create new and exciting products.

## Experience

### Ferchau Engineering UK (July 2017 to May 2020)  
### Stress / FEA Engineer
Joined as a FE specialist to work on aircraft certification in a contractor role. 
*	Created bespoke data analysis tools to speed up design e.g. a system to visualise results allowing us to quickly see the effects of changes to the structure; this facilitated weight savings in the final design by enabling several iterations
*	Involved in the upkeep of large models of the entire wing structure, generating and processing large amounts of data and providing inputs for component teams
*	Revamped the model interface load process by programming a tool in python that automated the factoring, combination and down-selection of results for thousands of fasteners across the entire wing, reducing the time of analysis from days to hours


### Sitec Engineering Ltd. (October 2015 to May 2017)  
### Stress / FEA Engineer

Headhunted by Airbus to join as a contractor through Sitec to act in a stress and integration role managing information flow between Sitec and Airbus.
*	Responsible for all landing gear models and organisation/management of the model delivery team
*	Innovated by helping update Airbus modelling techniques to incorporate more complex methods which had not been used before
*	Presented modelling conclusions to the customer (Airbus); conveying results clearly using visual tools, highlighting impacts and analysing causes
*	Learnt Python in my spare time and implemented it in the model checking and validation process, increasing efficiency

### Sogeti UK (September 2013 to June 2015)  
### Stress / FEA Engineer

Began to specialise in computer modelling and simulations.
*	Responsible for debugging / fixing the most problematic and complex model which had become the most critical activity for the entire aircraft project at the time
*	Created simple procedures to streamline the modelling creation and checking processes. This resulted in less failures and reduced running time


### Assystem UK Ltd. (January 2010 to September 2013)  
### Junior Engineer

Completed the graduate scheme and taken on as a junior engineer.
*	Trained in analysis methods, technical report writing and documentation
*	Chosen to represent the company on site with the customer for a military program


## Skills
#### Problem Solving
Uses analytical thinking and excellent attention to detail to identify and fix issues. Motivated to continually improve individual skills to help find new solutions, for example learnt python in spare time in order to create tools to streamline and automate processes in engineering roles.

#### Communication
Experienced in producing high quality technical documents used to support major design milestones and certification of aircraft. Confident in presenting to senior team members and external customers with results, root causes and impacts being conveyed in a clear concise manner

#### Reliability
Proven track record in delivering work to external customers and internal teams on time to a high standard. Recognised by management for flexibility and collaboration, providing support to team members which has added to team productivity and performance

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2021 to April 2021)

Completed 16 week bootcamp covering the following:
*	TDD & BDD: Used test driven methodology to turn requirements into functioning code
*	OOD & OOP: Applied SOLID principles to create code that is easy to modify and maintain
* Agile & XP: Team challenges organised using stand-ups, sprints, retros and Kanban boards
*	Pair Programming: Daily pairing to build collaborative skills and imitate work environments
*	EQ: Communication, feedback and empathy training to enable good working relationships
*	Self-led learning: The autonomous course structure required initiative and organisational skills

#### Cardiff University (September 2006 to May 2009)

- BEng Mechanical Engineering, 2.1

## Hobbies

### Sport
Iâ€™m an active person and like to keep fit. I particularly enjoy travelling to the alps for cycling or skiing. I'm training to do a triathalon for the first time this year.
### Music
I am an active member of two bands, playing guitar, bass and drums at live gigs and recording in the studio. I also enjoy listening to music, going to gigs and festivals.
