## Peter Allen

A former aerospace engineer looking to move into software development. Over the last 10 years I have worked across several aircraft projects, becoming an expert in structural stress anlaysis and advanced modelling and simulation techniques. I've always been into technology and like learning new things so taught myself python and began employing it at work. I enjoyed the problem solving aspect and the satisfaction of creating useful tools which has led me to make a career change.

## Experience

**Ferchau Engineering UK** (July 2017 to May 2020)  
Stress / FEA Engineer

- Created a program in python with a GUI using pyQT that took results from a structural simulation of the aircraft wing and stored the text based results into relational SQL databases. The program then combined results from multiple SQL files, applied different safety factors and then filtered the results on several criteria into a final output. This was achieved using numpy and pandas libraries with the combinations often created 100s of GB of data. The final results were visualised using matplotlib for checking then formatted back into text files that fed directly into the next analysis stage. The program was a success and very efficient, reducing the time of analysis from months to weeks.

## Hobbies

**Sport:** Iâ€™m an active person and like to keep fit. I particularly enjoy travelling to the alps for cycling or skiing. I'm training to do a triathalon for the first time this year.

**Music:** I love music and gong to gigs. I'm an active member of two bands, playing guitar, bass and drums at live shows and have recorded in the studio.
