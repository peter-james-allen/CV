## Peter Allen

A former aerospace engineer looking to move into software development. Over the last 10 years I have worked across several aircraft projects, becoming an expert in structural stress anlaysis and advanced modelling and simulation techniques. I've always been into technology, hence engineering, and taught myself to code in python finding out that I really enjoyed it. I get great satisfaction from solving problems and enjoy seeing a project  along with the opportunites to constanly learn and expand my skills.
