The following is an summary of what I covered during my time at Makers outlining what concepts I learnt each week along with examples of my code. Weeks 1-5 code was done purely in ruby, Javascript was introduced in week 6 and the final 2 week project is done using React with the MERN stack.

## Week 1

### Learnt to

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Examples

- [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/airport_challenge)

## Week 2

### Learnt to

- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Examples

- [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/takeaway-challenge)

## Week 3

### Learnt to

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

### Examples

- [Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/rps-challenge)

## Week 4

### Learnt to

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

### Examples

- [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/chitter-challenge)

## Week 5

This week was the first team project and we were introduced to the software development workflow

### Learnt to

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### Examples

- [Bowling Challenge (solo)](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/bowling-challenge-ruby)
- [MakersBnB (team)](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/makersbnb)

## Week 6

### Learnt to

- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### Examples

- [Bowling Challenge continuation in JS](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/bowling-challenge)

## Week 7

### Learnt to

- Build a frontend single-page app using only pure (Vanilla) Javascript.
- Request and use data from an external API.
- Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

### Examples

- [News summary Challenge (solo)](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/news-summary-challenge)
- [Note App (team)](https://github.com/charlierdm/noteApp)

## Week 8-9

Weeks 8 and 9 were spent on a team project making a clone of facebook using ruby on rails for the first time.

### Examples

- [Instagram Challenge (solo)](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/instagram-challenge)
- [Acebook Challenge (team)](https://github.com/ianmcnicholas/acebook-team.1)

## Week 10

This week was spent doing take home technical challenges focusing on writing code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.

- [Bank Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/bank-tech-test)
- [Gilded Rose Challenge](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

## Week 11-12

The final two weeks were spent on a team project of our choice. We decided to create a mobile app that is based around the idea of a dopamine menu using the MERN stack.

- [H-appy server](https://github.com/AJ8GH/h-appy-server)
- [H-appy client](https://github.com/peter-james-allen/h-appy-client)
