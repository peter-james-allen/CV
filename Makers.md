During my time at Makers Academy I st

Week 1
Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
Pair using the driver-navigator style
Follow an effective debugging process
Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
Wider course goals this week should help with (see all course goals here)
I can TDD anything
By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.
I can program fluently
You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.
I can debug anything
You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
Challenges
Afternoons - Boris bikes
End of unit - Airport
Practicals
These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.

Week 2
By the end of the week all developers can:

Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.

Start attending process workshops to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

Watch a short video explaining what Reviews are and how to use this valuable resource - and then consider booking one!
